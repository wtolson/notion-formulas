Notion Formulas is a Python library designed for composing and manipulating complex formulas for Notion programmatically. Enhance your Notion workspace by leveraging the power of Python to create and manage formulas.

## Installation

To get started with Notion Formulas, you can install the package using [pip][pip]:

```bash
pip install notion-formulas
```

## Usage

```python
from notion_formulas import Number, prop

x: Number = prop("x")
y: Number = prop("y")

print(x + y)  # Prints `prop("x") + prop("y")`
```

## API

The complete Notion Formulas API maintains consistency with the original names, with the following adjustments:

- Camel casing is converted to snake case (e.g., `replaceAll()` becomes `replace_all()`).
- Functions matching python keywords are modified with a trailing underscore: (i.g. `if()` becomes `if_()`).
- Constants are uppercased (i.g. `e` becomes `E`).

## Data types

The api is fully typed and defines following data types for expressions: `Boolean`, `Number`, `String`, and `Date`, allowing your formulas to be typed checked by [mypy][mypy].

## Examples

For a comprehensive example, refer to the code that generates a Taskwarrior style [urgency score][urgency-score] for a Notion task database in [examples/urgency.py](examples/urgency.py) and the associated output [examples/urgency.txt](examples/urgency.txt).
